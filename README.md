# Agentic-AI-build
ðŸ¤– WhatsApp-Based AI Customer Support &amp; Lead Generation Agent
Project Summary:
Developed and deployed a smart AI assistant on WhatsApp using Agentive to serve as a conversational lead generation and support agent. The system engages prospects in real time, answers their service-related queries, generates pricing quotes, and captures lead information for follow-up and appointment booking.

# Business Use Case / Workflow:

A prospect finds the WhatsApp number (on a website, QR code, or ad) and sends a message.

The AI responds with personalized info pulled from company documents.

If relevant, the bot calculates a quote.

It gathers and logs lead info if the user is interested.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack & Tools Used
Agentive AI: Built and deployed the WhatsApp chatbot agent to handle real-time customer conversations, simulate human-like dialogue, and maintain persistent sessions.

Relevance AI: Developed dynamic tools within the agent to:

Reference company FAQs from documents

Provide real-time service quotes based on property type and size

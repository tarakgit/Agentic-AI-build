# Agentic-AI-build (GUI based Framework)
ü§ñ WhatsApp-Based AI Customer Support & Lead Generation Agent
Project Summary:
Developed and deployed a smart AI assistant on WhatsApp using Agentive to serve as a conversational lead generation and support agent for Cleaning Business Service. The system engages prospects in real time, answers their service-related queries, generates pricing quotes, and captures lead information for follow-up and appointment booking.

# Business Use Case / Workflow:

A prospect finds the WhatsApp number (on a website, QR code, or ad) and sends a text message.

The AI responds with personalized info pulled from company KB documents.

If relevant, the bot calculates a quote. Also It gathers and logs lead info if the user is interested.
